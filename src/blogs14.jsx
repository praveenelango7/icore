                        <h2 className="blogs13_h2">Why is it important to speed up the website?</h2><br/>
        <p className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">For one, you lose visitors, and then there are some mind-boggling stats that you should know. </p>
        <img className="chatimg" alt="Why website speed matters" src={blog14poster}/>
        <p className="blogs_p">Next, for all search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing, load speed is a crucial assessment and ranking factor. The goal of search engines is to provide users with the best possible outcomes for their queries. With slow loading times, visitors are bound to be exasperated, and when speed criteria are, officially, not met, ranking is affected.</p><br/>
        <p className="blogs_p">Your bounce rate subsequently increases and users leave immediately even after they have landed on the page. Most of them just end up hitting the BACK button. Google actually, makes a note of this behavior and designates you as a low-quality site. </p><br/>
        <p className="blogs_p">This is also one of the biggest pain points of mobile sites.</p><br/>
        <h2 className="blogs13_h2">How to speed up WordPress websites?</h2><br/>
        <p className="blogs_p">We can draw several inferences about page loading speeds, primarily indicating if your WordPress site is slow. Here are some things that you can do to hasten page loading. </p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">1. Quality Hosting Services</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Choosing a good host is imperative to the smooth working of the website. While there might be several cheaper offers available, you must keep in mind that good hosting can lead you to better website speeds. Don’t pick an inexpensive host and wind up getting what you paid for. Stay away from shared hosting, and eliminate the risks of having bad neighbors on the server. This can actually slow down your site unless you have both, the manpower and budget to run a costly dedicated server. Run your website on a server that is specifically optimized for WordPress so that technical factors of managing a website is automatically covered.</p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">2. Up to date technology for the web</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">As redundant as the idea might sound, the core technology should always be upgraded. Ensure that PHP, HTML, and a host of other web technologies are in their newest versions containing updated features, and improvements while also contributing to improved speed. In fact, good quality hosting will always notify you when your PHP version goes out of date..</p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">3. The latest in WordPress</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Even WordPress has to be in its latest version to function smoothly. New features and bug fixes are included in the updated version of the CMS, make your website run efficiently. Besides speed, it also alleviates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icoresoftwaresystems.com/blog/how-to-protect-WordPress-website-from-hackers" className="updating_link"> security issues</a></p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">4. Themes</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Some themes on WordPress are bloated and when used, can slow your website down. These also contain several added-on features that will decelerate your website significantly, all because of its weight. The codes embedded in these themes are loaded each time the website is called, and in several cases is still running even when you are not using them. Find a lightweight theme that is filled with functionality through plugins.</p><br/>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">5. Image Sizes</h3>&nbsp;
      
        <p className="blogs_p">The size increment of a given webpage is susceptible to the images present on it. Without compromising on its quality, reduce the size of these heavyset images. The process might take a long time if you use other tools such as Photoshop or Chrome PageSpeed Insights extension. Instead, use the several plugins available for image optimization to fix the issue.</p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">6. Database maintenance</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">The database, just like WordPress gets weary over some time. Temporary disk space, unused data from plugins, post revisions, etc. are accumulated, leading to unnecessary heaviness. Regular database maintenance can keep it lean and functional. Use tools such as WP-Optimize, or WP-Sweep, both of which make the process convenient. You may want to reduce your post revisions, as well. If you are going to use wp_options, it is best to get a backup first. </p><br/>

        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">7. Page caching</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Whenever there is a request, WordPress creates an HTML version of your pages dynamically. Did you know that your website can slow down as a result? Alternatively, it is best to get a finished HTML page at all times and save yourself several steps while also speeding up your website. Page caching is one of the best ways to reduce page load times. Enable it with the help of a plugin available in the CMS such as the WP Fastest Cache, WP Super Cache, and W3 Total Cache. Several premium all-in-one caching plugins are available, which can also be quite heavy and inflated, breaking down the speed of your website.</p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">8. Monitoring</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Continuous monitoring helps you identify problems and rectify them before they do any damage. Measure website speed regularly with tools such as Pingdom that offer automatic monitoring. It is a worthwhile investment where after your registration, you will get an email if your website is running too slow. Another paid service is GTmetrix that provides you with key metrics such as visual render time, server response time, and much more.</p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">9. Using a CDN or Content Delivery Network</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Page load times are also affected by the location of the server. The farther the host from the visitor, the slower the transmission of data. Your static files are hosted on several servers all at once when you use a CDN or content delivery network thus resolving your speed issues. When a request is received to visualize your site, then users can beget answers from the closest possible location. Download time is lessened this way. </p><br/>
        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">10. File Minification</h3>
        <p className="blogs_p">Minify JS and CSS files using the Google PageSpeed Insights tool, which will regularly notify you for minification. You can improve the speed of your site when you reduce the number of CSS and JS calls, and subsequently, the size of these files. </p><br/>
