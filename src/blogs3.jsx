                        <p className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">Augmented Reality (A.R) is the latest kingpin for all the advanced technological systems and tools that are to come. The whole world of modernity revolves around AR's aura.</p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">AR implements the use of technology that will extend our physical world through the use of powerful digital projections. To keep up with this phenomenon, sectors and blue-chip businesses are learning how to merge their business processes with AR to offer an unforgettable experience to their customers.</p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Here is an excellent insight from our AR experts from iCore, an augmented reality app company in Texas, to delve deep into this interesting world and find what’s all the hype about augmented reality (A.R)</p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">AR overlays computer-generated graphics over any object, so it looks like a live projection. You must have played a good amount of smartphone games in which you open your smartphone camera to communicate with the imagined animated characters; all of these fantastic apps are based on augmented reality.
                        </p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Apart from the games, another interesting example is 3D navigation maps. Many smartphones nowadays come with a cool 3D navigation AR app system, which lets you project the navigation using a smartphone’s camera. Wouldn't this technology make future inventions more futuristic? It will certainly. When our way of living shifts and bends towards a more digital lifestyle, we will use these things more. All these will transform our lifestyle into a "smartly structured lifestyle."</p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Being a company that offers excellent augmented reality development services in Texas, we are here to dive deeper into the world of Augmented Reality technology and find out how this fascinating evolution of technology works and what makes it so unique and anticipative.</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">How AR works?</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">First, let's have a look at what are the main components that execute the whole process to grasp the idea. AR consists of three elements, namely:</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Software</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Specific pieces of software such as D'Fusion are implemented in applications based on the AR. Digital projection over a real-life model can be overlapped by using 3D software to manipulate. These program arrays are available for computers, and the smartphone app already comes with the full default package.</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Hardware</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Any AR-based tool's core components are the processor, cameras, input devices, and mostly the display. A smartphone, handheld device, smart glasses, or head-mounted displays (HMD) could be the display. The devices of input are either cameras or webcams. Sensors included an accelerometer and gyroscope. Mobile devices have all of the requirements needed for running an AR application.</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Remote Servers</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">The data must be made and maintained by cloud servers or a dedicated hosting network. Digital images and projections are downloaded from the web or cloud server, and shown via a smartphone, as per the request received from AR source. Considering that the data generated in the process may be huge, it is preferred to use a hosting service or cloud.</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">The principle of AR</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">You must have seen smart QR codes that include details about any product, such as pictures, brief description, and pricing, you only need to scan, and a 3D-based product would be visible, this comes under the AR applications based on the marker. When you scan such a QR or barcode, a request is sent to the servers and the cloud server returns the corresponding image on the smartphone after the request is processed. After this, the description of the product can be viewed.</p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Furthermore, the marker-less AR technique identifies artefacts that are not supplied directly to the client in advance. Compared to other approaches, this situation is complex because the object recognition algorithm is operating in the AR framework having to recognize the properties of objects such as colour, a pattern that may appear in camera frames.</p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">On the other hand, the GPS matches the position with the registered digital location on the servers when the location-based mobile apps are pointing towards a specific view. Once the position of computer vision is detected, the smartphone will retrieve the data, and the user will be shown digital projection on the screen or display. Sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometers are used for movements and orientation.</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Key innovations of AR you must know</h6>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Microsoft Hololens</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Hololens is Microsoft's amazing innovation which offers you a complete experience of mixed reality. It is a fine combination of VR headsets and AR's strength.</p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Technologies for AR marketing</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Businesses use virtual reality and AR technologies to flaunt their products. The user simply needs to open the device in these applications and can project the perceptions of the product to see how the object actually looks.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Makeup apps</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">In trying their luck, the skincare industry is no behind. Several popular brands have introduced apps where the consumer can try out various types of makeups available just like a filter.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        <p className="blogs_p">AR technology is the key development that is promising and is expected to transform several industries and alter the way we look at things. iCore Software, <u>an augmented reality development services</u> company in Texas has hands-on experience in AR technology.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
