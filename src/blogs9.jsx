              Software development trends are constantly changing, and it is
              extremely important to stay continuously updated about the most
              popular technology stacks that are currently governing the market.
              To build your software product you must choose the right
              technology stack to achieve your business goals along with the

              MEAN – MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js
            </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              One of the most popular stacks of the year, it runs on end-to-end
              JavaScript – which means you only use one language completely.
              Decrease unwanted reinventions and reuse the code across the
              entire application. Furthermore, it is open source and comes with
              the support of a robust community. Perfect for cloud hosting, the
              stack is flexible, extensible, and scalable. Deploy it on your own
              server or scale in on demand to accommodate temporary usage
              requirements. Developers work adaptively with the MEAN as it is
              easily integrated with a range of other platforms such as mapping,
              location finding, news aggregation, and calendars.{" "}

              MEVN – MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js  
            </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              Also, another version of the MEAN, where AngularJS is replaced by
              Vue.js, a front-end framework that has found immense popularity in
              recent years. With its ecstasy continuing through 2020 due to its
              lightweight characteristics when compared to Angular, Vue.js
              provides out-of-the-box functionalities that can also be extended
              to third parties. For great performance and a rich set of tools,
              you must use Vue.js, which also blends the best features of React
              and Angular.{" "}

              MERN – MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js 
            </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              Just like MEAN, the MERN stack includes React instead of
              AngularJS. Changes and modifications can be implemented rather
              easily since React uses Virtual DOM. It also uses JSX, an altered
              JavaScript, enabling seamless work across components. Used for
              building single-page applications with collaborative UIs, React is
              also one of the most popular frameworks for the creation of
              high-end applications.{" "}

            <h6 className="head_blogs">
              LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP 
            </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              A rather common means to deliver web applications, this was one of
              the first open-source software stacks made available and is still
              widely utilized. LAMP is also used by popular open-source CMS such
              as Drupal and WordPress. The stack is stable, simple to use, can
              efficiently handle dynamic pages, and most of all, non-proprietary
              that lets you choose the components depending upon your
              requirements. If you do not wish to use LINUX, you can change the
              platform to Microsoft Windows and make it a WAMP stack and with
              the MAC OS, it will be a MAMP stack. Against PHP you can replace
              it with either Perl or the highly popular Python language.

            <h6 className="head_blogs">FLUTTER for web</h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              To use the same UI and business logic across all platforms, use
              Flutter for Web, a game-changing cross-platform development stack.
              Besides, it also lets you build UIs, add new features, and fix
              bugs without compromising on the speed and having to spend time on
              deployment.
            </p>
            <h6 className="head_blogs">Serverless Stack</h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              Make infrastructure management easy with serverless computing
              platforms that encompass all services and tools. Now, this year,
              2020 is the best time to go serverless and bank on the cloud
              infrastructure. Scale up overnight and easily to hundreds of
              thousands of users.
