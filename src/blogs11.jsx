                        <p className="blogs_p">Today, AR is a culturally saturated technology subject that is slowly maturing. In the next few years, AR is all set to explode and find some common uses across our daily lives. For instance, you could use your smartphone to scan the engine of your car and visualize detailed schematics of the machinery or you could also see explanations for each button. This would mean no written manuals.

                        <p className="blogs_p">Immersive technologies were not ready for the mass consumer market, until recently, although these have been around for a long time – even before iPhones and social media.
                        </p>

                        <p className="blogs_p">Statista reports projected that the AR technology market will be valued at over $18 billion by the year 2023. Consumer spending on embedded AR mobile applications and standalone ones will attain about $15.5 million by the year 2022.
                        </p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">With AR on the rise, it is quickly finding base across product-driven industries, including eCommerce. However, digital stores are still repudiating the use of AR, mainly due to the lack of knowledge of its power to change the landscape of online selling.

                        <p className="blogs_p">iCore Software Systems develops cutting-edge Augmented Reality App in Texas. Here are some ways your eCommerce store can benefit from our services.</p>

                        <h5 className="blogs_h5">Filters</h5>&nbsp;
                        <p className="blogs_p">Social media or AR filters are popular across Instagram Stories. While these were initially brought in as a ‘fun’ factor, some of the brands instantly seized the opportunity to jump on to the bandwagon. There are several benefits to using social media filters:</p>
                        <ul className="custom_paddinglist">
                            <li className="all_liststyletype blogs_p">Showcase your product or service and increase awareness as customers can virtually test them for suitability.</li>
                            <li className="all_liststyletype blogs_p">Boost audience engagement as people are encouraged to tag you in their stories as they use the filter to enter a contest.</li>
                            <li className="all_liststyletype blogs_p">Moreover, you look special when you add an AR filter as you garner the ‘wow’ factor from your audience.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 className="blogs_h5">Previews</h5>&nbsp;
                        
        <p className="blogs_p">In eCommerce, customers often tend to buy the wrong product simply because they are unable to physically handle the product. With AR, potential customers can get a real-time glimpse of how the product may look like in their environment. Check out Sony Electronics’1 Envision TV AR app that allows you to see how a Sony TV fits against your existing decor.</p>

<h5 className="blogs_h5">Virtual personalized solutions</h5>&nbsp;

<p className="blogs_p">According to Narvar, a customer experience platform, about 46% of the retailers and 34% of the consumers returned bought goods from Amazon due to wrong personal credentials. While not all eCommerce solutions work with virtual try-on solutions, sensitive personal buying can always be simplified with virtual AR. For instance, if you are trying makeup, Sephora Virtual Artist1 lets you download an app and try the different array of products. You can also take a picture of your outfit and if you are a beginner, get a virtual tutorial.
</p>
<p className="blogs_p">Besides the above, you can also invest in interactive user manuals and user guides that are smart and respond to user actions.
