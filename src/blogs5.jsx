                            It is well known that people living in big cities face a variety of threats when commuting from one location to another. Okay, the two big ones: fatigue in traffic and misery in the parking of their cars. In order to solve this dilemma, a solution to this problem came in the form of UBER in 2009. The Uber is nothing but a taxi booking app that helps users to rent a cab for their trip.

                        <p className="blogs_p">
                            In fact, this leaves them safe rather than worrying with their vehicle accidents and other problems such as cleaning. All these things make people turn to Uber. As a result, Uber licensed the trademark as a profitable billion-dollar start-up. Uber's powerful growth has encouraged a range of companies including Ola, Lyft and more to get into the development of taxi booking app.

                        <p className="blogs_p">
                            Here are some key considerations that should be kept in mind when designing a taxi booking app
                        </p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Enrol the GPS features</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">
                            GPS technology is one of the most critical aspects of the taxi booking app. This is because if the driver approves the journey, the driver can get the rider's position from this GPS. Moreover, not every driver would have too much experience of the roads, and so this Global Positioning System allows the driver to meet the destination.
                        </p>

                        <h6 className="head_blogs">How GPS helps?</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">1. Tracks the customer's location </p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">2. Navigates the shortest and easiest path.</p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">3. Shows the closest taxi to the customer</p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Introduce dual payment option</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">
                            Riders will be provided on your application with various payment options. This makes the payment method quick and easy for passengers. Most people don't have a hand in cash in these days. To encourage this, several payment methods such as wallets, net banking, debit/credit and different electronic payment solutions should be implemented.
                        </p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Review Page</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">
                            By adding a review page, you will get reviews from both the driver and the passenger. Besides, this page should make customers know how important their feedback to you. It also helps to improve your business market and offers a better solution.
                        </p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Notifications and alerts</h6>

                        <p className="blogs_p">
                            This method will help the app owner to convey the deals, latest features and different choices to the customers. In fact, alerts are one of the easiest ways to communicate with people.
