        <p className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">WordPress files, plugins, login pages, and even themes are constantly targeted by hackers. To safeguard your platform from unwanted malware and virus attacks, necessary steps must be taken to recover your files, if there should be a cyber breach. For website owners who are aware of the topic, it is of utmost importance as they understand the exigence.

        <h3 className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3"><b><i>Fact: Google blacklists around 50,000 websites every week for phishing and more than 10,000 websites each day due to malware invasions.</i></b>

        <p className="blogs_p">WordPress security best practices should be considered seriously where you should protect your website, first, failing which it could cause significant damage to both reputation and revenue. User information and passwords are stolen and malicious software is installed, which is also distributed to your users. In worst case scenarios, you end up paying ransomware to gain access to your website, once again. Especially if you are a business website, you must pay extra attention to WordPress security.</p><br/>

                <br/>
                <p className="blogs_p">Whether it is a WordPress site or a phpBB forum, all these sites are under attack and being probed by hackers. Thousands of pages are scanned and hundreds of logins are tried on a daily basis by not just one but several hackers. Automated software is deployed by them to crawl or probe into a website for certain weaknesses. These crawlers are called bots, which are different from the scraper bots where the software copies the content.need help in updating your website?<a href="/web-application-development-company/#cms-dev" className="updating_link">click here</a></p><br/>
                <h2 className="blogs_h2">How to secure my WordPress website from hackers?</h2><br/>
                <h3 className="blogs_p"><b><i>Updating the website</i></b></h3>
                <p className="blogs_p">As an open-source software, WordPress is maintained and updated by a team of professionals, regularly. While minor updates are automatically installed, major releases need to be initiated manually. There are several themes and plugins that can be installed, which are well-maintained by third party developers. For the security and stability of your WordPress site, you must ensure that the latest releases provided by third party developers are updated periodically.</p>
                <h3 className="blogs_p"><b><i>Firewall security for your WordPress site</i></b></h3>
                <p className="blogs_p">Unwanted intrusions can be blocked by a WordPress firewall plugin called Wordfence. The software identifies a visitor’s behavior, and tries to match it against an abusive bot. Wordfence is based on analytics such as too many web pages in a short time, then it understands that rules have been broken and prepares to automatically block the bot. Legitimate bots such as Google and Bing are identified and allowed by Wordfence.</p>
                
                
                </div>
                <div className="col-lg-6">
                <img className="hacking_blog_side_img" alt="iCore-Google Website Warnings" src={blog12side}/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p className="blogs_p">Some advanced features also enable the publisher to see which bot is attacking a site. The source of the bad bot may also be identified by the software while holding the capability to stop it by a fake browser agent, complete IP address range or the IP address itself. Different user agents are used by bots in order to sneak in. Some of them may also act like a Windows XP browser. Using Wordfence you can create a rule to block all Windows XP OS user agents regardless of their source. With a paid version of the software, you should be able to even block entire countries that have illegal visitors to your website. iCore software systems have experienced professionals to configure wordfence for your <a href="/web-application-development-company/#cms-dev" className="updating_link">WordPress website</a></p>
            <h3 className="blogs_p"><b><i>Fortifying website security</i></b></h3>
                <p className="blogs_p">Sucuri owned by GoDaddy is another security tool and free plugin that provides an added security layer. It blocks bad bots from absorbing the benefits of certain types of attacks. All files are checked with its malware scanning feature, for alterations. User login alerts are produced that help publishers identify if hackers trying to log in. Sucuri’s free version contains features such as monitoring file integrity, auditing security activity, remote malware scanning, monitoring blacklists, security actions post-hack, and notifications. The paid version is even stronger and is inclusive of a website firewall.</p>
                <h3 className="blogs_p"><b><i>Login limitations to your site</i></b></h3>
                <p className="blogs_p">Login blockers come with certain features such as retry attempts per IP address that are fully customizable. Use the Limit Login Attempts Reloaded so that you can block all the hackers after a certain number of failed names and passwords. For instance, hackers may get blocked after three attempts of password guessing. Other features include optional email notification, possible whitelisting or blacklisting IPs or usernames, multi-site compatibility, GDPR compliance and others. It also contains a plugin that shuts down hack bots, continuously try guessing the password.</p>
                <h3 className="blogs_p"><b><i>Creating backups for your WordPress site</i></b></h3>
                <p className="blogs_p">A daily backup of the website should be automatically scheduled in case of any catastrophic event. If the website goes down, then it can be recovered with the help of the backup. Use WordPress backup plugins such as UpdraftPlus to configure the backups to your email every day and send them to cloud storage such as Dropbox.</p>
                <h3 className="blogs_p"><b><i>Auto-update themes and plugins</i></b></h3><br/>
                <img className="chatimg" alt="iCore-Auto-update themes and plugins" src={blog12down}/><br/><br/>
                <p className="blogs_p">Choose the Enable-auto-updates so that WordPress can automatically update all plugins and themes. This way publishers don’t have to log in often to perform the redundant task. The most up to date software are available thus preventing the presence of outdated plugins that can be easily hacked your website exorbitantly. But with premium versions you will experience better protection. While Wordfence and Sucuri are the best preferences for WordPress security, there are also others available in the market.</p>
