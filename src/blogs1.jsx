              Web applications are a type of distributed applications running on
              multiple computers and can communicate through the network or
              server. It is very useful for the enterprises to update and
              maintain without the need for software installation on the client
              computers. What's more, millions of people could use one
              application. They are used for retail online sales, banking,
              discussion boards, weblogs, webmail, etc.

              What is Java Web technology and how is it used in web
              applications?
            </h5>
            &nbsp;
            <p className="blogs_p">
              Java technologies and frameworks are cloud-based software
              libraries providing Java web applications with a user interface,
              or "view-layer." These frameworks are used to identify web pages
              and to handle the HTTP requests created from those web pages. Java
              Web Server is used for creating interactive websites. Java offers
              support over JSPs and Servlets for the web application. We can
              build a website with static HTML web pages but we need the web
              application when we want data to be dynamic. Java is the name for
              both the programming language that can be used to build complex
              web applications and the software platform that made use of this
              programming language as its most important component. Development
              companies make extensive use of it to develop stable, robust and
              scalable web applications.

              What are the types of Java technologies involved in web
              application development?
            </h5>
            &nbsp;
            <h6 class="head_blogs">
              1. JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL)
            </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library has the iterator and
              conditional tags to manage flow control, SQL database access tags,
              XML document manipulation, internalization, and widely used
              functions.
            </p>
            <h6 class="head_blogs">2. Java Servlet APIÂ </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              The JavaServlet API runs as an HTML user interface (UI) or GUI
              application on the server-side, without its own application. They
              are used to extend applications hosted on Web servers. Many web
              applications are developed using the Java Servlet extensions.
            </p>
            <h6 class="head_blogs">3. Java Server Pages Technology (JSP)</h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              The Java Server Pages Technology gives an easy and quick way of
              creating dynamic content. It encourages the incorporation of
              servlet code snippets into the text-based paper. JSP includes
              static data presented in text format, namely Wireless Markup
              Language (WML), XML and HTML. The JSP development elements define
              the dynamic content construction of the page.
            </p>
            <h6 class="head_blogs">4. Java Message Service API</h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              The Java Message Service API is the combination of Java technology
              and enterprise messaging. The JMS API is a powerful tool for
              addressing business computing issues.
            </p>
            <h6 class="head_blogs">5. JavaServer Faces Technology</h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              It forms an important UI framework to build web applications.
            </p>
            <h6 class="head_blogs">6. Java Naming and Directory Interface</h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              It provides naming and directory functionality and allows
              applications to access multiple naming and directory services.
            </p>
            <h6 class="head_blogs">
              7. JavaMail API and the JavaBeans Activation Framework
            </h6>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              It is used to send updates via e-mail. In conjunction, the
              JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) API can be used to determine
              the type of data, that encapsulates the access and discovers the
              available operations.
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              Apart from Java, other few web technologies are also actively
              used, they are namely
            </p>
            <p>1. Java Script</p>
            <p>2. Single Page Application</p>
            <p>3. Blockchain Technology</p>
            <p>4. Motion UI</p>
            <p>5. Bots or AI</p>
            <p>6. Cybersecurity</p>
            <p className="blogs_p">
              The sophistication of the web applications depends on the
              employing of various technologies such as the J2EE Connector
              Architecture; Java Authentication and Authorization Service
              (JAAS); Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB); SOAP with
              Attachments API (SAAJ); Java API for XML Registries (JAXR); Java
              Transaction API (JTA), and, etc.
