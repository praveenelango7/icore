                        <p className=" force-overflow blogs_p" id="style-3">Quality has always been one of the most important elements of success for any organization. Software Quality Assurance or SQA is a crucial step in the entire SDLC or Software Development Life Cycle with the pronounced objective of improving the end product, by maintaining the sanctity of processes and aligning quality assurance with the goals of the business while also staying compliant with regulatory standards.</p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">What is?</h6>
                        <p className="blogs_p">QA or Quality Assurance is, typically, regarded as a single step within the umbrella process of software development. In reality, it is a continuous process that identifies errors and weaknesses within a developed or under-developed software alongside implementing relevant mitigation measures. A sequential step to code development, deployment, and launch, QA is spread across the SDLC right from the start. Offering fresh, neutral, and independent perspectives to discover defects and bugs that would otherwise go unnoticed, the QA process ensures that potential failures are identified and proactively controlled without damaging the organization’s market reputation. Thus, QA helps a company test its products, analyze them, and make sure that the best possible result is delivered into the market while it also meets all the required standards and fulfills established business goals.</p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">Security Testing</h6>
                        <p className="blogs_p">Customers expect a product or service to function as it is advertised. Therefore, it is extremely important to iron out all the bugs before the final output reaches the stands. If security testing is not performed, then the final product is left open to potential threats, breaches, and other problems where sensitive data gets leaked. Compatibility testing ensures that the software performs across all browsers, and operating systems, while performance testing ensures that all desired system requirements are duly met.</p>
                        <h6 className="head_blogs">There are several values and benefits of QA within the SDLC.</h6>
                        <p className="blogs_p"><i>User satisfaction and experience</i></p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">Rapid technological advancements have created greater awareness, and speedier transitions, leaving the consumers looking for more. Today, a smooth experience is akin to brand loyalty, which in turn translates to user satisfaction. When quality and seamlessness are offered together, you can expect high levels of loyalty as QA testing ensures usable, scalable, and robust software applications that attract customer allegiance.</p>
                        <p className="blogs_p"><i>Efficiency</i></p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">Organizations can significantly eliminate the risks associated with software failure by weaving QA into their SDLCs. With a potent strategy in place, the QA team does not lose sight of customer requirements and might even take some creative liberties providing some ingenious results. QA within the SDLC ensures conformity to CMMI or Capability Maturity Model Integration and ISO 9000 standards.</p>
                        <p className="blogs_p"><i>Prevention is better than cure</i></p>
                        <p className="blogs_p">An adage, which holds true even today, software quality assurance is a preventive methodology to address functionality, performance, and security issues, beforehand. The possibilities of failure are completely eliminated when QA activities identify and eradicate processes that do not meet the relevant standards.</p>
            
            <p className="blogs_p"><i>iCore Software Technology uses Quality Assurance constructively through its agile processes where the scope of each sprint is short. Without gambling with the software’s quality, our engineers integrate QA practices right from the beginning to deliver high-value products to our customers. We do not take quality for granted.</i></p>
